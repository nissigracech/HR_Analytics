# HR Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to generate insights that can assist in decision-making. It uses employee and performance rating datasets, and integrates data analysis workflows between Python and SQL.

---

## Project Overview

The **HR Analysis** project aims to analyze employee data and performance ratings to identify trends, generate reports, and provide actionable insights for improving organizational efficiency. Key tasks include data integration, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

---

## Features

- **Integration**: Data seamlessly integrated from Python to SQL using Visual Studio Code.
- **Analysis**: Insights generated from datasets, such as employee details and performance ratings.
- **Visualization**: Clear visual representation of key HR metrics (e.g., performance trends, employee demographics).
- **Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards built using Power BI for dynamic reporting.
- **Scalable Workflow**: Suitable for further automation and reporting.

---

## Technologies Used

### Languages & Tools

- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: Database management and querying.
- **Power BI**: Building interactive dashboards.
- **VS Code**: Development environment.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` (data handling) 
  - `sqlalchemy` (SQL integration)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- Python (>=3.9)
- MySQL (or another SQL database)
- Visual Studio Code
- Power BI Desktop
- Required Python libraries:
  - `Pandas`
  - `sqlalchemcy`
  ```
  pip install pandas sqlalchemy
  ```

### 2. Project Structure

The project folder includes:

```
HR-Analysis/
│
├── integration.py          # Python script for SQL integration
├── datasets/
│   ├── employee_data.csv   # Employee details
│   ├── performance_data.csv# Performance ratings
│
└── README.md               # Project overview
```

### 3. Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Place your datasets in the `datasets` folder.

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

4. Run the `integration.py` file to:
   - Clean and preprocess the datasets.
   - Load data into your SQL database.
   - Perform SQL queries for analysis.
   ```bash
   python integration.py
   ```

5. Import the processed data into Power BI for dashboard creation.

6. Review analysis outputs and visualizations generated.

## Python-SQL Integration Details

The integration between Python and SQL involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Employee and performance rating datasets are loaded using `pandas`.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Missing values handled.
   - Columns standardized for consistency.

3. **SQL Connection**:
   - Using `sqlalchemy`, data is written to a SQL database.
   - Queries are executed to retrieve and analyze key metrics.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Results from SQL are visualized using Python libraries (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

5. **Dashboards**:
   - Processed data is imported into Power BI to create interactive and dynamic dashboards for reporting.

## Example Outputs

### 1. SQL Query Output:

Sample Query: Retrieve top 5 employees based on performance rating.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, PerformanceRating 
FROM EmployeePerformance
ORDER BY PerformanceRating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2. Visualizations:
- Bar charts for performance trends.
- Pie charts for department-wise employee distribution.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more dashboards for detailed HR insights using Power BI.
2. Automate report generation and email distribution.
3. Incorporate predictive analytics for employee attrition.
